# AppfluxRuby
### Compatibility Notes:

# Using `public_send`.
#  This restricts us to greater than or equal to 1-9 which should be fine.

### Configuration scheme.
# application_id: ''
# Detect type of application and generate responses accordigly.
# e.g.: If bugflux - Send exception notifications.
# If monitoring - Send metrics data..and so on...
